# VIS Project
This project is a very bad clone of [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/) and [bricklick](https://www.bricklink.com/). Serves well as a project.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install -D` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app, use docker:

```bash
docker compose up
```
